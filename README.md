## Summary
This project focuses on evaluating and selecting a baseline machine learning model using various data versions. Initially executed in a Jupyter notebook, the project is now being restructured for deployment in production or cloud environments, complete with organized directories and files for efficient management. The final output includes a report directory containing comprehensive performance metrics and visualizations of the selected models.

## Objectives

 * Data Preparation: Organize and preprocess multiple data versions for analysis.
 * Model Evaluation: Assess various machine learning models to identify the best performing baseline.
 * Performance Metrics: Compile and calculate key performance metrics such as F1-Score, Recall, Precision, and ROC-AUC.
 * Reporting: Generate a structured report that includes performance metrics and visual representations of model results.
 * Deployment Readiness: Ensure the project structure is suitable for deployment in cloud services or production environments.
